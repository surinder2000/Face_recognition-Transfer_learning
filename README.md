# Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task. Transfer learning is an optimization that allows rapid progress or improved performance when modeling the second task.

## Making a Face Recognition System using the weights of VGG16 model
In this project I am going to use pre-trained model approach for making Face recognition system. I am using the weights of VGG16 model which is trained on Imagenet dataset.
